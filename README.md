This intends to be a massive repository of everything that I use in school. This spans from trolling scripts for online apps, to full internet circumvention guides for the people who want to use their school internet without the worry of being blocked from certain websites or their IT department spying on them.



## My guide to internet censorship circumvention.

Just before I start I would like to say this. Throughout this guide I intend on being 100% factual, however as is inevitable, we make mistakes. I cannot guarantee everything in this guide is fully accurate, nor can I guarantee that it is fully up to date.

### I can't visit certain websites such as games and social media.

To overcome this, try some software called a VPN. A VPN is a tool that helps you use the internet safely and securely. It does this by making it look like you're accessing the internet from a different location, so no one can see what you're doing. It's like a secret tunnel that only you can use to get on the internet. This can be helpful if you're at school and there are websites that you're not allowed to visit. Using a VPN can help you access those websites without anyone knowing. 

While a VPN can help you use the internet safely and securely, it's important to understand that it's not 100% foolproof. There are always ways that someone with enough knowledge and resources can try to track what you're doing on the internet, even if you're using a VPN. That's why it's important to be careful about what you do online.

Recommended VPNs:

✅= Used by myself

Proton VPN ✅ | Free option available - Encryption 

Cyberghost | Free option available - Encryption

Express VPN ✅| Paid - Encryption

IVPN | Paid - Encryption

### Help. I tried a VPN, it didn't work.

Some schools may use more advanced censorship software than others. Try changing the encryption method on your VPN and see if that fixes it. If not, you may have to try more advanced software.  I tend to stay away from embedded proxy websites as the tracking capabilities of those websites are extensive and if malicious code were to be implemented it would be very effective.

### More advanced options
Software such as Shadowsocks or v2ray might need to be used if a regular VPN fails to work.
This software is much more advanced then VPNs and certainly isn't as easy as downloading a VPN, and clicking connect. It requires basic knowledge of Linux to make these servers yourself. This type of software is constantly changing, so do some research yourself and work out what would suit you better.
